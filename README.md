# APIAutomation
I did this assignment using Java with Rest Assured under BDD since my office laptop has some restrictions on installing.NET plugings to do this assignment ex -Spec flow.
To run this project, you need to have Java 8 or a higher version on your computer.
First, download the git and clone the project to your laptop
git repo -https://github.com/Dinithsusara/APIAutomation.git
Then open the code using intellij.
Go to the test folder.
You are able to see the test cases.
